# Hi, I'm Jonathan!

I'm a software developer, graphic designer, and generative artist based in Grand Rapids, MI.

I've always been passionate about creating things â€” illustration, animation, music, graphic design, and more. Most recently, my interests have turned toward computer software.

I currently work as a software developer & consultant at [Atomic Object](https://atomicobject.com), and in my free time I enjoy being outdoors, playing Nintendo Switch games, and making generative art.
